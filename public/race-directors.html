  <div class="question">What is Racepass all about? How does it work?</div>
  <div id="q33" class="answer collapse">Our mission is to help runners to run more races, and in turn for your races to have more runners. Racepass subscribers buy a certain amount of race credits and give us consent to register them for their desired races. Racepass then registers the runner directly with your race always using your preferred channels (e.g. your race management platform or provider) driving 100% of the retail value to you. Our goal is to build a product that is good for runners, and good for race directors. </div>

  <div class="question">How does Racepass partner with races?</div>
  <div id="q34" class="answer collapse">Racepass integrates directly and indirectly with races. If you see your race listed and we do not have a direct relationship, Racepass has worked with your race management platform or is listing it through sourced events databases from such organizations as USATF, etc. When a runner expresses interest in running your race, Racepass then signs the runner up through your preferred channels. </div>
</div>
